# SC OSR Template.

v0.1 Update Notes:

Tidied up all of top resets which never need changing, unstacked them to reduce amount of required code lines.

Reduced top:15%; on osr-content class to 10% - as 15% has been too high. Also reduced this to 5% for mobile.

Changed osr-overlay to black as default (so rgba 0,0,0, 0.7).

Added placeholder input focus hide, which will hide any placeholder text on input fields when you select them.

Added more code comments to separate relevant sections.

Added animation fade to osr-overlay class, and fade keyframe to Desktop styles.
